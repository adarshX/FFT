# FFT
Description : Implementation of Fast Fourier Transform over data imported from Excel using MATLAB.

FFT algo: 
You transform your data to s-domain by DFT and
Your time vector to a frequency vector by using sampling frequency.

X : time domain data
Y = fft(X) 

This Y  vector consists of the average values of X (DFT).
Y is not equal to the values of X.
